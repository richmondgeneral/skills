"""
Per-item state machine for rg-full-auto batch onboarding.

Tracks each item through the 10-phase pipeline independently.
State persists as .state.json inside each item's folder, enabling:
- Resume after failures
- Async user clarification (park → continue)
- Cross-session persistence

State file: <items_dir>/RG-XXXX/.state.json
